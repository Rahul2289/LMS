## 🖥️ How It Works

1. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. You will see the **welcome screen**:

   ```
   ========================================
   Welcome to LMS
   ========================================

   Who are you? Select any one below:

   1. ADMIN
   2. STUDENT
   3. TEACHER
   4. TURN OFF
   ```

3. Based on your choice:

   * **Admin →** Enter admin username & password.
   * **Teacher →** Enter teacher username & password.
   * **Student →** Enter student username & password.
   * **Turn Off →** Exits the program.

4. After successful login, you can perform role-based actions. Example:

   ```
   ****** ADMIN LOGIN IS SUCCESSFUL ******
   ```

5. Choosing **Logout** returns you back to the login menu instead of shutting down the program.
